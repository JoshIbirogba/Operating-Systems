//Program (C++)
This Program is designed to implement the banker's algorithm used to avoid deadlock and allocate resources safely to each process.


//Run the code/Limitations(C++)
To run this code, you can use any C++ compiler of your choice but i would walk you through the steps of using the Linux environment, powered by the ubuntu shell.
Fire/Power up Ubuntu, when the shell is active, press the command key ls to open a file path to the next directory, another prompt then comes up, press cd LabAssign5.
Press ls to open the next file directory path. One file becomes visible named bankersalgorithm.cpp
When this is all done input the command make at the next prompt.
The make command creates an executable, press ./test to run the code.
