//Program (Java and C++)
This Program is designed to create threads that will find the prime numbers of a particuar range of values in Java and C++.


//Run the code/Limitations(JAVA)
To run the program for Java, the netbeans environment will be a more comfortable option. Open up netbeans, copy the source code JavaThread.java to the IDE then
check for the run option in the IDE, click on the run option, click on set project configuration, click on customize and input the range of values you want to implement
the goal of finding prime numbers within a particluar range.

//Run the code/Limitations(C++)
To run this code, you can use any C++ compiler of your choice but i would walk you through the steps of using the Linux environment, powered by the ubuntu shell.
Fire/Power up Ubuntu, when the shell is active, press the command key ls to open a file path to the next directory, another prompt then comes up, press cd LabAssign4.
Press ls to open the next file directory path. One file becomes visible named thread.cpp.
When this is all done input the command make at the next prompt.
The make command creates an executable, press ./test to run the code.
